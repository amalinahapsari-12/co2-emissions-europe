# 🚗 Tracking Europe’s car emissions and the road to cleaner mobility (2000–2023)
Analysis of CO₂ emissions from new passenger cars across EU countries (2000–2023). The project tracks emission trends, compares country performance, and highlights gaps in Europe’s green transition.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **CO₂ emissions from new passenger cars** across EU countries between **2000 and 2023**.  
The goal is to:  
- Track emission trends over time  
- Compare country-level performance  
- Highlight progress in reducing emissions  
- Investigate gaps between best- and worst-performing countries  

---

## ❓ Key Questions  
1. Which countries had the lowest and highest emissions in 2023?  
2. How have emissions changed over time in the EU?  
3. How much progress has each country made since 2000?  
4. What is the gap between best- and worst-performing countries, and how has it evolved?

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights  

### 1. Trend of CO₂ Emissions (2000–2023)  
![Trend](visuals/viz_3_1_trend.jpg)  
**Insight:** Emissions fell sharply after 2008, reflecting EU policy impact. Progress slowed after 2015, with widening gaps across regions.

### 2. CO₂ Emissions by Country (2023)  
![Emissions 2023](visuals/viz_3_2_emissions.jpg)  
**Insight:** Nordic countries (e.g., Sweden, Denmark) lead with the lowest emissions, while Eastern and Southern Europe lag behind.

### 3. Change in Emissions Since 2000  
![Change](visuals/viz_3_3_change.jpg)  
**Insight:** All countries reduced emissions, but the pace is uneven — frontrunners cut nearly twice as much as laggards.

### 4. Best vs. Worst Performance Gap (2000–2023)  
![Gap](visuals/viz_3_4_range.jpg)  
**Insight:** The gap narrowed until 2015 but has widened again, showing acceleration in some regions and stagnation in others.  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- EU policies drove major emission reductions, especially post-2008.  
- Nordic countries lead; Eastern and Southern Europe lag.  
- Progress is uneven, showing need for stronger, consistent standards.  
- Since 2015, the performance gap has widened.

## 🌍 Overall Message  
EU policies cut car emissions effectively, but **progress is uneven**. Nordic leaders are accelerating, while laggards risk slowing Europe’s green transition.
