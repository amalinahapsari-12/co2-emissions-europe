# 🌍 CO₂ Emissions in Europe (2000–2023)

This project analyzes trends in CO₂ emissions across European countries between 2000 and 2023. Using data visualization and Python, we explore how emissions have changed over time, differences among countries, and the impact of environmental efforts.

## 📌 Key Insights

- Many European countries have significantly reduced their emissions since 2000.
- Western and Northern Europe show more consistent downward trends.
- Outliers and sudden changes can indicate policy shifts or economic changes.
